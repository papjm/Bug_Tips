one way of confirming that the application is interacting with a backend database is to submit the SQL wildcard character % in a given parameter. 
For example, submitting this in a search fi eld often returns a large number of 
results, indicating that the input is being passed into a SQL query. Of course, 
this does not necessarily indicate that the application is vulnerable â€” only that 
you should probe further to identify any actual fl aws.
